          Sometimes it’s hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill. Try sharing
          that bill week in, week out and you might encounter more than a few
          snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our automated
          payment system takes care of the rest. You need never talk money or
          who owes what.
